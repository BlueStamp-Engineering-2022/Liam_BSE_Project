# Chess AI
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
N/A (For now)

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone in making my Chess AI, I ended up switiching from Unity to a program called Jupyter Notebook. This allowed me to use the python chess library, which simplified getting the actual game working. From here, I had to make the AI itself. Due to the time crunch, I ended up coding the AI in a day with methods called minimax, and alpha-beta pruning, which are algorithms that sort through possible moves using a database of piece values and positions that allow the AI to decide where to move. To move forward, I will add UI elements, as well as iron out any bugs still left in the program.

# First Milestone
I am in the process of creating a chess AI. My first milestone was getting a working chess board with pieces, as well as pawns that are moveable in typical chess rules. I encountered numerous challenges in the designing process, first among them, getting a working board. This caused many problems, but I ended up with what I believe is the most efficiant solution. This solution is to create an array of "cells", that were used to keep track of the color and location of each specific square on the grid. The next task was to create the pieces. To do this, I created a second array of integers that were used to keep track of piece location. Specific numbers were used to denote each piece and their color (ie. 3 is equal to a white pawn, and 13 is equal to a black pawn). The next challenge was getting each piece to move in accordance to the specific rules of chess.

# Starter Project
My starter project was the useless machine. The main components were the PCB, acrylic box, and motor (in this case, the motor just takes a signal from the switch and uses that to determine which way to spin. It spins by using the magnetic forces of two magnets which cause the motor "arm" to spin). To construct the machine, we first soldered the components (switch, resistors, LED, etc.) on to the PCB. Next, we assembeled the motor by screwing it into two acrylic plates which would hold it within the box that we were to build later. After this, we constructed the acrylic box, and it was here I encountered my first problem, in that the box had to be assembeled in a very specific way otherwise it would all collapse. Another problem I created for myself was over-soldering the switch onto the PCB. This caused a short, and meant that the motor would turn left, but not back to the right. This is because of how the switch works, in this 6 pin switch, the two main pins are 2 & 5 which always run. Then, when you flip the switch either way, it either connects to pins 1 & 4 or 3 & 6 (depending on the switch direction). Thus, I had accidentaly soldered pins 2 & 3 together, meaning it was consistently sending a signal as if the switch was always in the ON position. After re-soldering this mess, the project was nearly done. The final hurdle was screwing in the self-tapping screws which proved to be quite the challenge. The best solution here was to drill the hole with a power tool as opposed to using a typical screwdriver. During this process, I enjoyed soldering the PCB and the utter relief that comes when you get the self tapping screw fully screwed
