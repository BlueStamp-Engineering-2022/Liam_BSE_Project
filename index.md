# Starter Project
My starter project was the useless machine. The main components were the PCB, acrylic box, and motor (in this case, the motor just takes a signal from the switch and uses that to determine which way to spin. It spins by using the magnetic forces of two magnets which cause the motor "arm" to spin). To construct the machine, we first soldered the components (switch, resistors, LED, etc.) on to the PCB. Next, we assembeled the motor by screwing it into two acrylic plates which would hold it within the box that we were to build later. After this, we constructed the acrylic box, and it was here I encountered my first problem, in that the box had to be assembeled in a very specific way otherwise it would all collapse. Another problem I created for myself was over-soldering the switch onto the PCB. This caused a short, and meant that the motor would turn left, but not back to the right. This is because of how the switch works, in this 6 pin switch, the two main pins are 2 & 5 which always run. Then, when you flip the switch either way, it either connects to pins 1 & 4 or 3 & 6 (depending on the switch direction). Thus, I had accidentaly soldered pins 2 & 3 together, meaning it was consistently sending a signal as if the switch was always in the ON position. After re-soldering this mess, the project was nearly done. The final hurdle was screwing in the self-tapping screws which proved to be quite the challenge. The best solution here was to drill the hole with a power tool as opposed to using a typical screwdriver. During this process, I enjoyed soldering the PCB and the utter relief that comes when you get the self tapping screw fully screwed
